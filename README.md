# ApSUMA

This repository was used for a practical exercise for subject "Ingeniería de Requisitos" (Requirements Engineering) during my Software Engineering studies at University of Málaga.

It is an e-learning application focused on integrating academic studies with community service to enrich students' learning, encourage civic responsibility and strengthen communities.
